# Chatbot

A repository showing how to create an elementary chatbot in PHP. The intent isn’t that this is the best example in the world, but that it shows an example of how it’s done.

So, if you’re expecting purity, you’re going to be disappointed. But, if you’re keen to learn the basics, then welcome my friend!

## Installation

To install the project, clone the source to create a project from it; such as by:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:settermjd/chatbot.git your_project_name
```

Once you’ve got the source available, you need to retrieve your Slack API token and replace `enter_your_token` in `bootstrap.php` with your Slack API token.

After that’s done, you need to set it up on a public-facing web server somewhere, likely by using Apache or Nginx. With all these steps completed, you’re ready to begin.
